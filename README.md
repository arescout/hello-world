# hello-world

Hello people of the internet and GitHub!

I'm following a tutorial telling me to do this so here we go. I live in Uppsala, Sweden, I study IT engineering and I have this feeling that I haven't really accomplished anythin in my life. I realised I like coding though, so that's a start!

Also, I need a better keyboard.
